# RootBA Testing Data Repository

This repository is part of the "RootBA: Square Root Bundle Adjustment" project.

Please see the main repository for further information: https://github.com/NikolausDemmel/rootba

The *testing* data repository contains a small subset of our dataset
mirror repository at
https://gitlab.vision.in.tum.de/rootba/rootba_data; the data included
here is used in the tutorial and for unit tests. Please check out the
full dataset mirror repository if you want to evaluate whole datasets.

*From the dataset mirror repository:*

This serves as a mirror of some SfM datasets the are usable with the
RootBA code. In some cases we converted the data format or applied
preprocessing for convenience.

Please refer to the subfolders for further information on data sources
and pre-processing procedures, and refer to the linked sources for
details on the datasets and licensing.
